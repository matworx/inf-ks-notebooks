It’s considered off-policy because the q-learning function learns from actions that are outside the current policy, like taking random actions, and therefore a policy isn’t needed. More specifically, q-learning seeks to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward."

Acting randomly is important because it allows the agent to explore and discover new states that otherwise may not be selected during the exploitation process. You can balance exploration/exploitation using epsilon (ε) and setting the value of how often you want to explore vs exploit. Here’s some rough code that will depend on how the state and action space are setup."
